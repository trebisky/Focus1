# pasm

This is the PRU assembler, as I used it in this project.

Dates on the source files are from 2013

It does not appear that I rebuilt or modified it in any way.
I just copied pasm_2.arm to /usr/bin/pasm and was good to go.

Note the license file by Texas Instruments.

This was part of a package called am335x_pru_devel on my
system, which also included the pruss driver.
This software was in am335x_pru_devel/pru_sw/utils
I also see this package called "am335x_pru_package"
and there is every chance in the world that it has
been developed further and/or enhanced since 2013.
This is a topic for me to investigate at a future time.

The Makefile may well be my own handiwork.
